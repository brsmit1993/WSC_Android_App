    <h2>Locate your device's MAC (or physical) address</h2>
    <p>In order to use set-top boxes, smart TVs, game consoles, Ethernet-connected computers, and Blu-Ray players on campus you must register the device and connect to the WSC-Guest network. To register your device, you need the MAC (or physical) address, which you can locate using the instructions below for your respective device.</p>
    <p>Some devices are designed to be used on a home, or small-scale, network and may not work (even if registered properly) on our large, enterprise network. Our Service Center staff will do their best to help, but cannot gurantee a network connection for devices such as Google Chromecasts, Google Home devices, Amazon Echo devices, Apple HomePod, wireless printers, or most "smart home" tech such as smart lightbulbs, smart plugs, etc.</p>
